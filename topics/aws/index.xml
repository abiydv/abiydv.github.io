Amazon MQ supports industry standard APIs such as JMS and NMS, and protocols for messaging, including AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket.
two types of broker storage – durability optimized (EFS), and throughput optimized (EBS).
For high volume applications, throughput optimized storage is better, can provide the required throughput and optimize costs by reducing the number of brokers required.</description>

Questions How is CloudFront different from Global Accelerator? https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-accelerators.html
What is Origin Group? ORIGIN Group - configure 2 origins, mark one as primary, and the other as secondary. Configure status codes to trigger fail over. If primary origin returns one these configured status codes, CloudFront then sends the request to the secondary origin.</description>

      <description>Trails No IAM roles needed for cross-account delivery. #todo What principal does it show if you enable data events on the log delivery bucket?
Lake Ingest events into an event data source, and run sql queries on this data source.
Data can be collected from AWS (like CloudTrail events), custom application or 3rd parties (like okta system log)
Pricing is based on data ingestion, analysis and retention. It can retain data up to a maximum of 10 years.</description>

      <description>What is it? AWS Config records and saves configuration of supported resources.
You can use these records to audit whether the resources align to best practices, or org specific patterns/rules. It can also highlight 2-way relationships between different resources. For ex - an instance is related to a vpc, a subnet, and a security group. This relation will show up in both the instance, and vpc records under relationships.

      <description>Questions What is a cloudhsm in kms? Use AWS CloudHSM when you need to manage the hardware security modules (HSMs) that generate and store your encryption keys. In AWS CloudHSM, you create and manage HSMs, including creating users and setting their permissions. You also create the symmetric keys and asymmetric key pairs that the HSM stores. Features Think of KMS as an additional layer of authentication and authorization. If a client cannot access the AWS KMS, the public key from an asymmetrical key pair can be used to encrypt the data.</description>

      <description>AWS Application Load Balancer AWS Network Load Balancer AWS Gateway Load Balancer GWLB’s ability to use 5-tuples or 3-tuples of an IP packet to select specific appliance behind it for life of that flow combined with Transit Gateway appliance mode, provides session stickiness irrespective of source and destination AZ. 1
A Gateway Load Balancer operates at the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the network layer.
It maintains stickiness of flows to a specific target appliance using 5-tuple (for TCP/UDP flows) or 3-tuple (for non-TCP/UDP flows).</description>

AWS Local Zones are a new type of AWS infrastructure designed to run workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency, like video rendering and graphics intensive, virtual desktop applications. Local Zones allow customers to gain all the benefits of having compute and storage resources closer to end-users, without the need to own and operate their own data center infrastructure. Local Zones are available in 33 metros globally. enable the AWS Local Zones for your AWS account before you can deploy resources to them.</description>

      <description>Features cross-zone disabled by default
NLB provides a network interface in each AZ backed by a static IP. This static IP can be used to configure AZ specific DNS records.
NLB forwards the requests to the same AZ target in which it receives the request. This is useful to maintain AZ affinity and reduce costs due to cross AZ traffic.
NLB is a layer-4 device, works on layer-4 protocols, and is inherently sticky.</description>

Be ready for impairments before they happen
Over-provisioning is not necessarily a bad thing. It can provide some static stability in the sense that an AZ failure will not cause a full outage, the existing capacity in other AZ can continue to handle the load while the fault recovers or additional capacity is provisioned reactively to the AZ failure event.</description>

      <description>Questions What is the scope? AZ, Regional, Global
When or why will you choose both CloudFront AND Load balancer?
What is an AZ? AZ or availability zone is an independent data center within a specific geographic region. An AWS Region is a collection of multiple availability zones. Regarded as a fault boundary. Data transfer across AZ is not free. Cross AZ traffic should be controlled for cost optimization and performance efficiency.</description>

If a customer doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to connect to AWS over the internet, they can alternatively use Direct Connect. This ensures the traffic to/from AWS flows through the customer&amp;rsquo;s network directely on to AWS backbone network without going over the internet.

      <description>Object storage offering 99.999999999% (11 nines) data durability.
Internals Based on Amazon Dynamo (not the same as DynamoDB) - technology developed internally at amazon for a incrementally scalable, highly available key-value storage system.
This article by DR. Werner Vogels, is an interesting read on how S3 came to be!
Scope Regional, although AWS does call it global at places.
Can you create a bucket without specifying a region?
Consistency read-after-write consistency for PUT, and DELETE requests Strongly consistent for reads, always returns the most recent data.</description>

      <description>Features Think of it as a device which exposes the S3 storage as iSCSI, SMB or NFS mounts to on-prem workloads.
Launch it as a VM in your on-prem data center, or install the [[#Hardware Appliance]]. Reduces the need to re-engineer these workloads to work with S3. Helps with replicating on-prem data to S3 for backups or archival needs. On-prem workloads get access to low latency access to S3 data Data lake access for pre and post processing tasks.</description>
