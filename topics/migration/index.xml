Rehosting Lift and shift
Homogeneous (made of same things before/after) No changes to the applications, simply move the location from on-prem to cloud.
Tools = VM Import/Export, [[#Application Migration Service (MGN)]]
Replatforming Lift, tinker and shift
Homogeneous (made of same things before/after) No big changes to the applications, simply move the location from on-prem to cloud, while choosing some low hanging fruits. Like moving to a database-as-a-service offering.</description>

      <description>While VPN connections are OK, for some critical workloads, VPN over internet may not be stable or available enough.
If a customer doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to connect to AWS over the internet, they can alternatively use Direct Connect. This ensures the traffic to/from AWS flows through the customer&amp;rsquo;s network directely on to AWS backbone network without going over the internet.
Cost effective, secure, performant private network connectivity between on-prem private network and AWS.</description>

      <description>Features Think of it as a device which exposes the S3 storage as iSCSI, SMB or NFS mounts to on-prem workloads.
Launch it as a VM in your on-prem data center, or install the [[#Hardware Appliance]]. Reduces the need to re-engineer these workloads to work with S3. Helps with replicating on-prem data to S3 for backups or archival needs. On-prem workloads get access to low latency access to S3 data Data lake access for pre and post processing tasks.</description>
