      <description>Features Think of it as a device which exposes the S3 storage as iSCSI, SMB or NFS mounts to on-prem workloads.
Launch it as a VM in your on-prem data center, or install the [[#Hardware Appliance]]. Reduces the need to re-engineer these workloads to work with S3. Helps with replicating on-prem data to S3 for backups or archival needs. On-prem workloads get access to low latency access to S3 data Data lake access for pre and post processing tasks.</description>
