Features 4 9s SLA
Connect to S3 using &amp;ldquo;Data Repository&amp;rdquo;
Auto import, auto export to keep data in FSx in sync with data in S3
Lazy loads the files as they are accessed so there could be latency when the file is first accessed
FSx, and S3 bucket should be in same region to setup auto-import
POSIX permissions are maintained when moving data between S3 and FSx</description>

      <description>Object storage offering 99.999999999% (11 nines) data durability.
Internals Based on Amazon Dynamo (not the same as DynamoDB) - technology developed internally at amazon for a incrementally scalable, highly available key-value storage system.
This article by DR. Werner Vogels, is an interesting read on how S3 came to be!
Scope Regional, although AWS does call it global at places.
Can you create a bucket without specifying a region?
Consistency read-after-write consistency for PUT, and DELETE requests Strongly consistent for reads, always returns the most recent data.</description>

      <description>Features Think of it as a device which exposes the S3 storage as iSCSI, SMB or NFS mounts to on-prem workloads.
Launch it as a VM in your on-prem data center, or install the [[#Hardware Appliance]]. Reduces the need to re-engineer these workloads to work with S3. Helps with replicating on-prem data to S3 for backups or archival needs. On-prem workloads get access to low latency access to S3 data Data lake access for pre and post processing tasks.</description>
