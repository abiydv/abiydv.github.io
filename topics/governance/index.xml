      <description>What is it? AWS Config records and saves configuration of supported resources.
You can use these records to audit whether the resources align to best practices, or org specific patterns/rules. It can also highlight 2-way relationships between different resources. For ex - an instance is related to a vpc, a subnet, and a security group. This relation will show up in both the instance, and vpc records under relationships.
