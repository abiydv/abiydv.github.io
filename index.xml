      <description>Introduction Typically, read only data for business intelligence queries. Companies have multiple different OLTP databases. Data is Extracted from these, Transformed, and Loaded into a data warehouse (OLAP). Why not use OLTP directly for analytics queries? Access controls on business critical data Analytics queries often need aggregation, leads to performance issues when reading large amounts of data. Suitable for column oriented storage. Each record has hundreds of columns, but most queries only read 3 or 4 columns at most.</description>

self contained, no dependency problems
portable, platform independent
OCI Open containers initiative ensures compatibility between containers created in different container engine env
Architecture build on top of linux kernel features
namespaces provide strict isolation at kernel level
cgroups provide resource allocation to ensure dedicated resources to containers
selinux helps enforce security, can also secure access to containers from the kernel

      <description>Introduction Ciphers Algorithms, workflows Symmetric Asymmetric References As an outside-the-box approach, some organizations choose to encrypt sensitive data via code, processing the data while it is in the web servers and before transmitting it to the next tier. Access to the decryption keys is granted to specific application servers that handle decryption requests. This scheme can be extended further, to the user side, by encrypting the sensitive data field using a public key in the client-side code before transmitting it to the web server.</description>

      <description>Which pod goes where?
How does it help? Opportunities for cost saving by utilizing better scheduling. snorkel ai case-study Restrict workloads to specific nodes. Ex - run gpu workloads on gpu nodes, or don&amp;rsquo;t run cpu-only workloads on gpu nodes. Some users want to put multiple pods that communicate with one another in the same zone to avoid inter-zone traffic charges [[aws-well-architected#AZ Affinity]]
Anti-affinity is useful to spread pods across failure domains/topology (AZ or Region)</description>

Questions How is CloudFront different from Global Accelerator? https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-accelerators.html
What is Origin Group? ORIGIN Group - configure 2 origins, mark one as primary, and the other as secondary. Configure status codes to trigger fail over. If primary origin returns one these configured status codes, CloudFront then sends the request to the secondary origin.</description>

      <description>Trails No IAM roles needed for cross-account delivery. #todo What principal does it show if you enable data events on the log delivery bucket?
Lake Ingest events into an event data source, and run sql queries on this data source.
Data can be collected from AWS (like CloudTrail events), custom application or 3rd parties (like okta system log)
Pricing is based on data ingestion, analysis and retention. It can retain data up to a maximum of 10 years.</description>

      <description>What is it? AWS Config records and saves configuration of supported resources.
You can use these records to audit whether the resources align to best practices, or org specific patterns/rules. It can also highlight 2-way relationships between different resources. For ex - an instance is related to a vpc, a subnet, and a security group. This relation will show up in both the instance, and vpc records under relationships.

In a VPC, AWS reserves the network range +2 address for DNS server.
What are R53 resolvers? Inbound endpoint
For queries from on-prem systems to resolve AWS hosted domains.
Outbound endpoint
For queries from AWS workloads for on-prem systems.
You can specify rule for directing queries from inbound/outbound EP.
Limit - 10,000 queries per second per IP Address for an EP.</description>

Be ready for impairments before they happen
Over-provisioning is not necessarily a bad thing. It can provide some static stability in the sense that an AZ failure will not cause a full outage, the existing capacity in other AZ can continue to handle the load while the fault recovers or additional capacity is provisioned reactively to the AZ failure event.</description>

      <description>Questions What is the scope? AZ, Regional, Global
When or why will you choose both CloudFront AND Load balancer?
What is an AZ? AZ or availability zone is an independent data center within a specific geographic region. An AWS Region is a collection of multiple availability zones. Regarded as a fault boundary. Data transfer across AZ is not free. Cross AZ traffic should be controlled for cost optimization and performance efficiency.</description>

      <description>While VPN connections are OK, for some critical workloads, VPN over internet may not be stable or available enough.
If a customer doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to connect to AWS over the internet, they can alternatively use Direct Connect. This ensures the traffic to/from AWS flows through the customer&amp;rsquo;s network directely on to AWS backbone network without going over the internet.

Features Multiple VPCs can connect to a single transit gateway, which can allow on-prem connectivity via direct connect or cross region connectivity via transit gateway peering.
When using a VPN, or direct-connect, each VPC must only be connected to the TGW, which in turn is coonected to the DC or VPN.</description>

An isolated virtual network present in your AWS account. There is a default VPC present. However, it is recommended to create your own custom VPC based on your environment.
You can create a IPv4 only or Dual stack (IPv4 + IPv6) VPC.
Default VPC You can modify, delete, recreate a default VPC Creating a default VPC does not need VPC specific permissions as all resources are created by AWS</description>

Replicated across 3-AZ, so high availability, and data durability. Auto-scaling Delay between data ingestion, and retrieval is typically less than a second. Multiple applications can consume data from the same stream and do different things in parallel, like for ex - processing and archiving. Use cases Logs intake, processing Real-time metrics and reporting Real-time streaming Complex stream processing like DAG (Directed Acyclic Graphs) by ingesting from multiple [[#Kinesis#Data Streams]].</description>

      <description>Features Think of it as a device which exposes the S3 storage as iSCSI, SMB or NFS mounts to on-prem workloads.
Launch it as a VM in your on-prem data center, or install the [[#Hardware Appliance]]. Reduces the need to re-engineer these workloads to work with S3. Helps with replicating on-prem data to S3 for backups or archival needs. On-prem workloads get access to low latency access to S3 data Data lake access for pre and post processing tasks.</description>

      <description>Introduction Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers certifications in 4 broad categories - Foundational, Associate, Professional and Speciality. I recently cleared the Solutions Architect Associate certification. This time, wanted to attempt a &amp;ldquo;Speciality&amp;rdquo; certification. And what better topic to delve into than Cloud security. As much of a boon cloud is, it&amp;rsquo;s Achilies&amp;rsquo; heel remains unsecure workloads. Although AWS provides a ton of tools to mitigate and potentially limit security incidents, but they still do happen and often cost not just in monetary terms but also reduced customer confidence.</description>
