      <description>Introduction Terraform has evolved and established itself as the defacto tool for implementing IAC (Infrastructure As Code) across cloud and other service providers. The Google trends graph is a testament to it&amp;rsquo;s growing popularity.
I have been using it for the last few years for my projects and it&amp;rsquo;s a great fit in most situations.
I had always read about their certification, but never got around to dig deeper. Until last week.</description>
